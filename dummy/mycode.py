To effectively manage machine scheduling information, we construct a Machine Graph that incorporates machine capability, availability, and preference information. This Machine Graph enables seamless communication among manufacturing things, facilitating a comprehensive understanding of the ongoing manufacturing environment. After that, Knowledge Graph-enhanced Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning is proposed with new design of observation, action, reward, cooperation mechanism, and training method combining preference information. By incorporating preference information, our proposed method achieves improved training efficiency compared to individual Reinforcement Learning during the training stage, and it outperforms heuristic rules and individual Reinforcement Learning in optimizing makespan during the dynamic application stage.
